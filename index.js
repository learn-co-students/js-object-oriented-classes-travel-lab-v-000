// During off peak hours, a driver travels three blocks in a minute, while during

//blocksTravelled â€” returns an integer with the number of blocks travelled.
//In New York City, to travel East and West you cross avenues, and to travel
//North and South you cross streets. To calculate the distance in streets, you
//can use subtraction (eg. 13th street to 10th street is three blocks).
//To calculate the distance in avenues travelled, you will need to know the
//names and order of avenues in New York City. You can use the following array
//to help with your calculation:
