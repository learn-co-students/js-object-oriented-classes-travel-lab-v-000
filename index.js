// A route is initialized with two arguments, a beginningLocation and an endingLocation.
// Both of these arguments are JavaScript objects with an attributes of horizontal and vertical.
//
// blocksTravelled â€” returns an integer with the number of blocks travelled.
// In New York City, to travel East and West you cross avenues, and to travel North and South you cross streets.
// To calculate the distance of in streets, you can use subtraction (eg. 13th street to 10th street is three blocks).
// To calculate the distance of avenues travelled, you will need to know the names and order of avenues in New York City.
// You can use the following array to help with your calculation:
// let eastWest = ['1st Avenue', '2nd Avenue', '3rd Avenue', 'Lexington Avenue', 'Park', 'Madison Avenue', '5th Avenue']
//
// So to travel from 15th Street and 1st Avenue to 20th Street and
// Lexington Avenue is to travel eight blocks (five blocks North and three blocks West).
